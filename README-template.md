## Overview

My first challenge at frontend Challenge: a mortgage calculator where users input their mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submiting a simple form.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
